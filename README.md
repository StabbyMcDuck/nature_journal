# nature_journal

A children's Nature Journal for iOS made by Gabriella Fraenk (designer) and Regina Imhoff (programmer) for the ATX Diversity Hackathon 2017 sponsored by Women Who Code - ATX.

This app is designed for children who enjoy going out into nature and want to document their adventures outside without disrupting nature. We also designed this app to be usable and accessible to children who are pre-literate, as they cannot use a typical paper-based nature journal.

This is a Swift 4 app for iOS 11.  Future updates include geo-tagging, adding text or audio option for when kids learn to read and can write their observations down, a sketch pad for drawing pictures in addition to a photo/video, and a tagging system for different categories of collections (rocks, flowers, tree, etc.)

This app was made with :heart: in Austin, Texas.
