# nature_journal

A children's Nature Journal for iOS made by Gabriella Fraenk (designer) and 
Regina Imhoff (programmer) for the ATX Diversity Hackathon 2017 sponsered by 
[Women Who Code - ATX](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Austin/).  

This app is designed for children who enjoy going out into nature and want to 
document their adventures outside without disrupting nature.  We also designed 
this app to be usable and accessable to children who are pre-literate, as 
they cannot use a typical paper-based nature journal.  

This app was made with :heart: in Austin, Texas.
